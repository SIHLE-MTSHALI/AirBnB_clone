                <p>Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even though we did not meet in person) and everything went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>

              <li><h3>From Connor the 4th January 2017</h3>
                <p>Adrienne's place is great and Adrienne herself is an excellent host. The place is exactly as pictured. It's clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. Adrienne was a a great host, she was easy to communicate with and she made check-in and check-out a breeze. Highly recommended!</p>

            Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown, the Fair Grounds(Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen and living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a handmade counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.
